Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.[30]

                Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[</bold></p></td>

    <h1>Uses</h1>
<p style="max-width: 1500px;font-size: 20px;"><bold>Since 2003, Python has consistently ranked in the top ten most popular programming languages in the TIOBE Programming Community Index where, as of February 2021, it is the third most popular language (behind Java, and C).[167] It was selected Programming Language of the Year (for "the highest rise in ratings in a year") in 2007, 2010, 2018, and 2020 (the only language to do so four times[168]).[169]

    An empirical study found that scripting languages, such as Python, are more productive than conventional languages, such as C and Java, for programming problems involving string manipulation and search in a dictionary, and determined that memory consumption was often "better than Java and not much worse than C or C++".[170]
    
    Large organizations that use Python include Wikipedia, Google,[171] Yahoo!,[172] CERN,[173] NASA,[174] Facebook,[175] Amazon, Instagram,[176] Spotify[177] and some smaller entities like ILM[178] and ITA.[179] The social news networking site Reddit was written mostly in Python.[180]
    
    Python can serve as a scripting language for web applications, e.g., via mod wsgi for the Apache web server.[181] With Web Server Gateway Interface, a standard API has evolved to facilitate these applications. Web frameworks like Django, Pylons, Pyramid, TurboGears, web2py, Tornado, Flask, Bottle and Zope support developers in the design and maintenance of complex applications. Pyjs and IronPython can be used to develop the client-side of Ajax-based applications. SQLAlchemy can be used as a data mapper to a relational database. Twisted is a framework to program communications between computers, and is used (for example) by Dropbox.
    
    Libraries such as NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib allow the effective use of Python in scientific computing,[182][183] with specialized libraries such as Biopython and Astropy providing domain-specific functionality. SageMath is a computer algebra system with a notebook interface programmable in Python: its library covers many aspects of mathematics, including algebra, combinatorics, numerical mathematics, number theory, and calculus.[184] OpenCV has python bindings with a rich set of features for computer vision and image processing.[185]
    
    Python is commonly used in artificial intelligence projects and machine learning projects with the help of libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, Pytorch and Scikit-learn.[186][187][188][189] As a scripting language with modular architecture, simple syntax and rich text processing tools, Python is often used for natural language processing.[190]
    
    Python has been successfully embedded in many software products as a scripting language, including in finite element method software such as Abaqus, 3D parametric modeler like FreeCAD, 3D animation packages such as 3ds Max, Blender, Cinema 4D, Lightwave, Houdini, Maya, modo, MotionBuilder, Softimage, the visual effects compositor Nuke, 2D imaging programs like GIMP,[191] Inkscape, Scribus and Paint Shop Pro,[192] and musical notation programs like scorewriter and capella. GNU Debugger uses Python as a pretty printer to show complex structures such as C++ containers. Esri promotes Python as the best choice for writing scripts in ArcGIS.[193] It has also been used in several video games,[194][195] and has been adopted as first of the three available programming languages in Google App Engine, the other two being Java and Go.[196]
